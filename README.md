## 🚀 Flutter API Multi-Tab App

A Flutter application demonstrating REST API integration, JSON model parsing, service-layer architecture, and asynchronous state management using FutureBuilder.

This project fetches and displays data from multiple endpoints including Users, Quotes, and Posts.

---

## 📱 Features

🔹 Fetch data from REST APIs

🔹 Parse JSON into Dart model classes

🔹 Service-layer architecture (separation of concerns)

🔹 Async state handling using FutureBuilder

🔹 Tab navigation (Users / Quotes / Posts)

🔹 Loading indicators and error handling

🔹 Clean folder structure
